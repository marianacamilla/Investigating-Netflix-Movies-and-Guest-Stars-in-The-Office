**ðŸŽ¥ðŸ“º Investigating Netflix Movies and Guest Stars in The Office**

&nbsp;&nbsp;Applying the concepts learned from Introductory Python and Intermediate Python, using libraries, plotting graphs, and performing analysis.

### Description: ###

&nbsp;&nbsp;By doing this project, I applied the knowledge learned from Python to solve a real-life problem. In this project, I found out if Netflix movies are getting shorter over time. You can see the analysis and step-by-step process in the Jupyter Notebook. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Through this project, I improved my skills in real-world applications, gained more experience, and enhanced my data science skills.

### Applied Skills: ###
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Lists, Dictionaries, and DataFrames
- Data visualization (graphs)
- Reading CSV files

### About the Project: ###

**Guided project:**
_A guided project to analyze a dataset of Netflix Movies, using pandas and matplotlib._

&nbsp;&nbsp;Steps/Tasks:
1. Loading your friend's data into a dictionary
2. Creating a DataFrame from a dictionary
3. A visual inspection of our data
4. Loading the rest of the data from a CSV
5. Filtering for movies!
6. Creating a scatter plot
7. Digging deeper
8. Marking non-feature films
9. Plotting with color!
10. What next?

**Project done with DataCamp.**
